The most important choice to make when planning your trip is whether you're coming to our Desert Rave.

<h3>Attending the Wedding</h3>
<p>
If you're planning to head straight to Sparrows, this is what we recommend:
</p><p>
Palm Springs Airport (PSP) is the most charming airport we've ever been to. It's adorable. It's also incredibly convenient and close (a 7 minute drive) to Sparrows Lodge.  Unless you plan further explorations before or after the wedding, there is no need to rent a car; a taxi or rideshare will work just fine.
</p><p>
There are direct flights to PSP from DFW, Seattle, JFK, Oakland, Denver, Phoenix, LA, and Vegas. 
</p><p>
If you would like to travel with other wedding guests, please let us know and we'll put you in touch.
</p><p>
From other airports, Sparrows Lodge is 142 miles (2.5 hours) from San Diego, 277 miles (4-5 hours) from Vegas, and 125 miles (2.5-5 hours) from LA.
</p><p>
We recommend arriving mid-day to evening on Thursday, November 20th, and departing mid-day or later on Sunday, November 23rd.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>

<h3>Attending the Rave and the Wedding</h3>
<p>For attending the Rave, a car or carpool is mandatory (we can help arrange).  Reasonable flight options are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fly into and out of Palm Springs (PSP).</li>
	<li>Fly into and out of Vegas (LAS), join us for the convoy down, and drive back after the wedding (make sure to allow enough time).</li>
	<li>Fly into Vegas, join us for the convoy, and fly out of Palm Springs.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Although it may be possible to fly in early on Wednesday, November 19th and make the Rave before dark, a more relaxed option would be to fly in Tuesday the 18th and spend a night at your arrival city.  Fly out mid-day or later on Sunday the 23rd.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
