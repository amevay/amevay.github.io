<div id="what">
<h3>What is a desert rave?</h3>
<p>The Rave is a chance to begin arriving, to see us and meet family and friends, to dance, to party, and to experience the astounding beauty of the desert.  All are welcome, and none will be out of place.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="location">
<h3>Where exactly will this be?</h3>
<p>The Rave will be in the vicinity of Ludlow, CA, which is roughly halfway between Palm Springs and Las Vegas, and about a 2.5hr drive from either.  The exact location will be provided to RSVP'd Rave attendees via email prior to the event.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="when">
<h3>When is the Rave?</h3>
<p>Wednesday, November 19th.  We are aiming to arrive in the afternoon.  We recommend that you try to arrive before dark (~5pm).  We will stay the night and depart the following day.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="travel">
<h3>How do I get there?</h3>
<p>The Rave will be several miles off road, far from any airport, so a car or carpool is a must (we can help connect drivers or riders).  While most cars should be able to make it, we recommend driving something with more ground clearance if possible, such as an SUV, crossover, 1982 Vokswagen Vanagon, or pickup.</p>
<p>We are planning to convoy from Las Vegas.  You are welcome to join us should your travel plans align.  Please see the <a href="itineraries.html">Itineraries</a> section for more information.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="weather">
<h3>What will the weather be like?</h3>
<p>The weather will be colder than Palm Springs.  High winds and dust are possible.  Prepare for overnight lows down to freezing.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="sleep">
<h3>Where do we sleep?</h3>
<p>We hope you will join us in camping out, whether in a tent, camper, or RV.  We have a small number of tents we can lend.  If you would like to attend but not camp out, you can book Wednesday night at Sparrows Lodge (book through the link, then call to add the extra day and verify latest check-in time), or find other lodging.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="bathrooms">
<h3>Are there bathrooms?</h3>
<p>The Rave location is in open desert, and there are no bathrooms or other services.  Please take care of as much business as possible before leaving the pavement.  The Rave is a Leave No Trace event.  Specifically, please find a nearby bush (not open desert) for #1, and pack out any toilet paper used.  #2 must be buried if you do not have a means of packing it out.  See <a href="https://lnt.org">lnt.org</a> for more information on Leave No Trace camping.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="trash">
<h3>What about food, water, and trash?</h3>
<p>Please bring the food and water you may desire for the event, and pack out all trash.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
