Suggested Packing list

Sense of humor, JOY! 

Hat, swim suit. Sunglasses. Sunscreen. Two nice outfits. Comfortable pool/loungewear for time at Sparrows. If you’re interested in going for a hike, possible shoes, although Alex will be barefoot. 

Light jacket. It could get chilly in the evenings 

Electrolytes 



Apart from the hike, you likely will not need any emergency snacks. Elizabeth travels with a stash of secret meaty snacks and has never needed them at Sparrows. 




Children

You’re welcome to bring your children. There are no spare beds or cots. If you have questions about this please call Sparrows or talk with us. There might be an option for air mattresses. Normally Sparrows is 21+, but as we booked the full venue, we’re allowed to include all our favorite little ones. 



Fridge

There are fridges in every room at Sparrows! There is not a coffee machine, nor cooking spaces or microwaves. 



Electronics. 

Sparrows has no TVs or phones in the rooms. It’s part of the relaxing charm. The groom has held out on cell phones since Valentines Day, 1979. This is (hopefully) the one time we’ll ever get married. We would love to ask for your support to only use your phone for pictures outside your room. If you could please keep devices and conversations about work (and politics) to the privacy of your room, that would be truly a gift. Thank you!
