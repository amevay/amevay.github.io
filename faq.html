Weather

At the end of November, Palm Springs Weather is typically pleasant, with mild daytime temperatures and cooler nights. Daytime temperatures usually range from 70-80°F. Evenings can drop to around 50-60°F. Expect clear skies and little to no rain. 



The salt water pool will be heated! There’s also a hot tub. 



Suggested Packing list

Sense of humor, JOY! 

Hat, swim suit. Sunglasses. Sunscreen. Two nice outfits. Comfortable pool/loungewear for time at Sparrows. If you’re interested in going for a hike, possible shoes, although Alex will be barefoot. 

Light jacket. It could get chilly in the evenings 

Electrolytes 



Apart from the hike, you likely will not need any emergency snacks. Elizabeth travels with a stash of secret meaty snacks and has never needed them at Sparrows. 



Music

There will be no YMCA. You are safe with us. 



Rental Car



Indoors vs Outdoors

We will have our wedding ceremony outdoors. Most of the weekend will be outside, apart from time alone in your rooms, and the after-wedding party. 





Flights



This is the week before Thanksgiving and we understand many of you are eager to book flights.



The most important choice to make when planning your trip is whether you’re coming to our Desert Rave. 



If you’re planning to head straight to Sparrows and not participate in the rave, this is what we recommend:

Palm Springs Airport, PSP, is the most charming airport we’ve ever been to. It’s adorable. It’s also incredibly convenient and close (a 7 minute drive) to Sparrows Lodge. 



There are direct flights to PSP from DFW, Seattle, JFK, Oakland, Denver, Phoenix, LA, and Vegas. 

If you would like to travel with other wedding guests, please let us know and we’ll put you in touch.



If you’d like to not fly into PSP, Sparrows Lodge is a 2.5 hour drive from LA (125 miles), 4.2 hour drive from Vegas (277 miles), 2.5 hr drive from San Diego (142 miles)



Massages

If you would like a massage over the weekend, please call Sparrows at 760-327-2300 to book. There is a dedicated massage building and the masseuses are excellent. Richard is exceptional at tight-jaw release. It is $XX



Children

You’re welcome to bring your children. There are no spare beds or cots. If you have questions about this please call Sparrows or talk with us. There might be an option for air mattresses. Normally Sparrows is 21+, but as we booked the full venue, we’re allowed to include all our favorite little ones. 



Fridge

There are fridges in every room at Sparrows! There is not a coffee machine, nor cooking spaces or microwaves. 



Electronics. 

Sparrows has no TVs or phones in the rooms. It’s part of the relaxing charm. The groom has held out on cell phones since Valentines Day, 1979. This is (hopefully) the one time we’ll ever get married. We would love to ask for your support to only use your phone for pictures outside your room. If you could please keep devices and conversations about work (and politics) to the privacy of your room, that would be truly a gift. Thank you!
