<div id="devices">
<h3>Are cell phones permitted at Sparrows?</h3>
<p>Yes, however, the Bride and Groom request that, aside from taking photos and listening to music via headphones, all device use is kept to your room.  Phones, laptops, tablets, etc., are not appropriate in the common areas of Sparrows, such as the courtyards, den, pool area, bar, dining areas, orchard, etc.  Please bring a book (e-readers OK), a smile, and leave discussions of work and politics at home.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="beds">
<h3>Can I book a room with more than one bed?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, the rooms as Sparrows Lodge have one bed each, and there are no cots available.  We do, however, have a few air mattresses available which can be used in the larger Garden rooms only.  Please contact us if you would like to use one.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>

<div id="kids">
<h3>Are children welcome?</h3>
<p>Children listed on your invitation are welcome.  Normally Sparrows is 21+, but as we booked the full venue, we're allowed to include all our favorite little ones.  The rooms include small fridges, which may be helpful for parents of young children.  Please also see <a href="#beds"><u>Can I book a room with more than one bed?</u></a>.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="car">
<h3>Do I need to rent a car?</h3>
<p>If you are attending only the wedding, and flying into Palm Springs, you can skip the car and use a taxi or rideshare.  If you are attending the rave, you will need a car or carpool plan.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="massage">
<h3>I want a massage.</h3>
<p>Me too.  Call Sparrows at 760-327-2300 to book. There is a dedicated massage building and the masseurs and masseuses are excellent. Richard is exceptional at tight-jaw release.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="short">
<h3>Can I stay at Sparrows for two nights?</h3>
<p>Sparrows is available for bookings of 3 nights (11/20-23) or longer.  Although Thursday night may feel "extra", we hope it will allow people to fully arrive and relax in time for the festivities.<a href="#top">^</a></p>
</div>

<div id="elsewhere">
<h3>Can I stay elsewhere?</h3>
<p>Yes, but we hope you will join us at Sparrows.  <a href="#top">^</a></p>
